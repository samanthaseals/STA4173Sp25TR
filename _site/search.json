    "text": "Note: this is an abbreviated syllabus. The full syllabus is available through Classmate and/or Canvas.\n\nInstructor Information\n\nDr. Samantha Seals\nOffice: 4/344\n\n\n\nMeeting Times and Location\n\nMW 1:00-2:15 pm\nClassroom: 51/152\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\nMonday: 2:30–4:30 pm (Central)\nWednesday: 2:30–4:30 pm (Central)\nThursday: 10:00 am–12:00 pm (Central)\nOther times by appointment\n\n\n\nGrading and Evaluation\nThe course grade will be determined as follows:\n\nAssignments (25%): Each module will include an activity for students to complete using Quarto and R. The resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated dropbox on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nProject (40%): You will work with your research team to complete a research project. There will be several check ins completed during the project period. The resulting .pdf file should be submitted to the designated dropbox on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nOUR Symposium (10%): Each team will put together a research poster based on the project. All research teams will present their poster at the symposium.\nFinal Exam (25%): The final exam will be a timed concepts-based exam. While there may be some calculations needed, you will not be processing raw data. The final exam will be in class 11:00 am-1:30 pm on April 30, 2025.\n\n\n\nLate Policy\nAssigments have due dates, however, the dropboxes will not close until the end of the semester. All students are automatically granted “extensions” without question.\nNote that if there is not a submission when I go to grade (after the initial deadline), I will assign a zero (0) and request that you submit the assignment when you are able to. This is only for record keeping purposes. There is no penalty for submitting late and a full grade will be given upon review of your submission.\nExtensions are not available for the projects or final exam.\n\n\nImportant University Dates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\n\n\n\n\nJan 8 (Mon)\nSpring begins.\n\n\nJan 14 (Tues)\nDrop/Add period ends.\n\n\nJan 20 (Mon)\nMartin Luther King’s birthday - campus closed.\n\n\nMar 17-23 (Mon-Fri)\nSpring Break - campus closed.\n\n\nApr 7 (Mon)\nWithdrawal deadline (automatic grade of “W”).\n\n\nMay 5 (Fri)\nLate withdrawal deadline (“W” or “WF”, see requirements below)."
