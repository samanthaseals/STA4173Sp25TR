Consider a sample of data from the [Jackson Heart Study](https://www.jacksonheartstudy.org/). In this problem, we will be examining body mass index (*BMI*; kg/m<sup>2</sup>) as a function of health as categorized by physical activity (*PA3cat*: Ideal Health, Intermediate Health, and ).**\n\n**a. Find the appropriate summary statistics to fill in the table below; note that we are creating columns for each category of *PA3cat*. Continuous variables should be described using the mean and standard deviation while categorical variables should be described using the count and column percentage.**\n\n|        | Ideal Health (*n* = ?) | Intermediate Health (*n* = ?) | Poor Health (*n* = ?) |\n|--------|----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Age    | mean (sd)            |                             |                     |\n| Weight | mean (sd)            |                             |                     |\n| BMI    | mean (sd)            |                             |                     |\n| SBP    | mean (sd)            |                             |                     |\n| Current or Former Smoker |  n (column %)  |                 |                     |\n\n<!-- hint! \ndata %>% # for the continuous variables\n  group_by(PA3cat) %>% \n  summarize(mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE), \n            sd_age = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE),\n            mean_weight = mean(weight.na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),\n            ..... continue for the other variables)\ndata %>% # for the categorical variable\n  group_by(PA3cat) %>% \n  count(everSmoker)            \n-->\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**b.

Use the Kruskal-Wallis to determine if there is a difference in BMI (*BMI*) between the three levels of health as categorized by physical activity (*PA3cat*). Test at the $\\alpha=0.01$ level. Remember to typeset your hypothesis test.**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n**d. State, explain, and assess the ANOVA assumptions. Remember to state your conclusion (that you either meet the ANOVA assumptions or you do not).**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n**e. Based on your responses in part (d), which test's result are you going to present to the lead scientist at the JHS? (Hint: you will pick either the analysis (b) or (c)).**\n\n\n\n**f. Perform the appropriate posthoc test to determine pairwise differences between the three groups. Test at the $\\alpha=0.01$ level. Make sure that you state the resulting pairwise differences.**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n**g.

Include summary statistics, results of your chosen hypothesis test from part (f), and the graph from part (g).**\n\n\n\n\n**2. Again, consider the sample of data from the JHS. In this problem, we will be examining systolic blood pressure (*sbp*; mmHg) as a function of health as categorized by body mass index (*BMI3cat*), smoking status (*everSmoker*), and the interaction between health as categorized by body mass index and smoking status.**\n\n**a. Find the appropriate summary statistics to fill in the table below; note that we are creating columns for each category of *BMI3cat*.
