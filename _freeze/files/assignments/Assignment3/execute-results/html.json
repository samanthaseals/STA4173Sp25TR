The airline's data analyst was assigned to estimate the revenue (in thousands of dollars) generated by each of the 22 small airports based on two variables: the distance from each airport (in miles) to the hub and the population (in hundreds) of the cities in which each of the 22 airports is located. The data are given here: [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ZN0jMYdVsG2ucIJFSTquVRW916Jj-JmZIGQuqSQhy0/edit?usp=sharing).**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# DO NOT EDIT THIS CHUNK\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gsheet)\nairline_data <- gsheet2tbl('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ZN0jMYdVsG2ucIJFSTquVRW916Jj-JmZIGQuqSQhy0/edit?usp=sharing')\n# DO NOT EDIT THIS CHUNK\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n**1.
