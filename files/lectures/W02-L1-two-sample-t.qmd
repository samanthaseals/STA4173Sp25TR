## **Introduction**

- In the last lecture, we focused on *describing* data.
    
    - Continuous data: mean with standard deviation, median with interquartile range
    - Categorical data: count with percentage

- Today, we will focus on drawing *conclusions* about two population means using data.

    - Confidence intervals
    - Hypothesis testing
    
## **Confidence Intervals**

::: {.callout-note}
## Point Estimate
The single value of a statistic that estimates the value of a parameter.
:::

- Examples of point estimates:

- It is necessary to know how good our estimation is, or to quantify our uncertainty. 

::: {.callout-note}
## Confidence Interval
A range of plausible values for the parameter based on values observed in the sample. 

$$
\text{estimate} \pm \text{margin of error}
$$
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Level of Confidence
The probability that the interval will capture the true parameter value in repeated samples. i.e., the  success rate for the method.
:::

## **Confidence Intervals**

<center><img src="images/L02a.png"></center>

## **Confidence Intervals**

- Because CIs are a range of values, we will use interval notation,

<center>(lower bound, upper bound)</center>

- where
    - lower bound = point estimate -- margin of error 
    - upper bound = point estimate + margin of error
- Make sure to state your confidence intervals in numeric order.
    - i.e., the lower bound must be the smaller number and the upper bound must be the larger number.

## **Confidence Interval for $\mathbf{\boldsymbol \mu_1-\boldsymbol\mu_2}$**

::: {.callout-note}
## $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for $\mu_1-\mu_2$
$$
(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) \pm t_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2 }{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}
$$
where $t_{\alpha/2}$ has $\text{min}(n_1-1, n_2-1)$ degrees of freedom. 

:::

- To construct this interval, we require either:
    - the two populations to be normally distributed or
    - the sample sizes are sufficiently large ($n_1 \ge 30$ and $n_2 \ge 30$)

- R syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false
t.test(continuous_variable ~ grouping_variable,
       data = dataset_name,
       conf.level = confidence_level) 
```

## **Confidence Interval for $\mathbf{\boldsymbol \mu_1-\boldsymbol\mu_2}$**

- Recall the Palmer penguin data,

```{r}
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
penguins
```

## **Confidence Interval for $\mathbf{\boldsymbol \mu_1-\boldsymbol\mu_2}$**

- Let's find the 95% confidence interval for the difference in average weight (*body_mass_g*) between male and female (*sex*) penguins.

- Remember the R syntax:
```{r}
#| eval: false
t.test(continuous_variable ~ grouping_variable,
       data = dataset_name,
       conf.level = confidence_level) 
```

- What is the continuous variable?

- What is the grouping variable?

- What is the dataset name?

- What is the confidence level?

## **Confidence Interval for $\mathbf{\boldsymbol \mu_1-\boldsymbol\mu_2}$**

- Let's find the 95% confidence interval for the difference in weight (*body_mass_g*) between male and female penguins.

```{r}
t.test(body_mass_g ~ sex,
       data = penguins,
       conf.level = 0.95) 
```

- Thus, the 95% confidence interval for $\mu_F - \mu_M$ is (-840.6, -526.2).

## **Confidence Interval for $\mathbf{\boldsymbol \mu_1-\boldsymbol\mu_2}$**

- What about the 99% confidence interval for the difference in weight (*body_mass_g*) between male and female penguins?

```{r}
#| eval: false
t.test(body_mass_g ~ sex,
       data = penguins,
       conf.level = 0.99) 
```

- What do you expect? Recall that the 95% CI was (-840.6, -526.2).

## **Confidence Interval for $\mathbf{\boldsymbol \mu_1-\boldsymbol\mu_2}$**

- What about the 99% confidence interval for the difference in weight (*body_mass_g*) between male and female penguins?

```{r}
t.test(body_mass_g ~ sex,
       data = penguins,
       conf.level = 0.99) 
```

- Thus, the 99% confidence interval for $\mu_F - \mu_M$ is (-890.4, -476.4).
    - Recall that the 95% CI was (-840.6, -526.2).

## **Hypothesis Testing**

- A friend of yours wants to play a simple coin-flipping game. 
    - If the coin comes up heads, you win; if it comes up tails, your friend wins. 
    - Suppose the outcome of five plays of the game is T, T, T, T, T. 
    - Is your friend cheating?
    
## **Hypothesis Testing**

- A friend of yours wants to play a simple coin-flipping game. 
    - If the coin comes up heads, you win; if it comes up tails, your friend wins. 
    - Suppose the outcome of five plays of the game is T, T, T, T, T. 
    - Is your friend cheating?
        - We know the probability of flipping a tail is 0.5.
        - We can compute the probability of flipping five tails in a row.
        
$$
\begin{align*}
     P[\text{T, T, T, T, T}] &=  0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \\
     &= 0.03125
\end{align*}
$$ 

- **Is this probability low enough to believe your friend is cheating?**

## **Hypothesis Testing**

::: {.callout-note}
## Hypothesis Testing 
A procedure, based on sample evidence and probability, used to test statements regarding a characteristic of one or more populations.
:::

- **Steps in hypothesis testing**

    1. Make a statement regarding the nature of the population.
    
    2. Collect evidence (sample data) to test the statement. 
    
    3. Analyze the data to assess the plausibility of the statement.

- Note: if we have population parameters available, we do not need to perform a hypothesis test.

## **Hypothesis Testing: Hypotheses**

::: {.callout-note}
## Hypothesis 
A statement regarding a characteristic of one or more populations.
:::

- In hypothesis testing, we have two hypotheses: the null and the alternative. 

::: {.callout-note}
## Null hypothesis, $H_0$ 
A statement to be tested. 

- This is a statement of no change, no effect, or no difference. 
- It is assumed true until evidence indicates otherwise.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Alternative hypothesis, $H_1$ 
A statement that we are trying to find evidence to support.
:::

## **Hypothesis Testing: Hypotheses**

- **One sample tests**:
    - Two-tailed test
        - $H_0:$ parameter = some value
        - $H_1:$ parameter $\ne$ some value
    - Left-tailed test
        - $H_0:$ parameter $\ge$ some value
        - $H_1:$ parameter $<$ some value
    - Right-tailed test
        - $H_0:$ parameter $\le$ some value
        - $H_1:$ parameter $>$ some value 

## **Hypothesis Testing: Hypotheses**

- **Two sample tests**
    - Two-tailed test
        - $H_0:$ parameter~1~ -- parameter~2~ = 0
        - $H_1:$ parameter~1~ -- parameter~2~ $\ne$ 0
    - Left-tailed test
        - $H_0:$ parameter~1~ -- parameter~2~  $\ge$ 0
        - $H_1:$ parameter~1~ -- parameter~2~ $<$ 0
    - Right-tailed test
        - $H_0:$ parameter~1~ -- parameter~2~ $\le$ 0
        - $H_1:$ parameter~1~ -- parameter~2~ $>$ 0

## **Hypothesis Testing: Errors**

- We use data to draw conclusions about hypotheses.
    - We will either *reject* or *fail to reject* the null ($H_0$).
- If we draw the wrong conclusion, we make an error.
- These can be classified as Type I ($\alpha$) or Type II ($\beta$) errors.
    - $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are probabilities (i.e., are between 0 and 1).

<center><img src="images/L02b.png"></center>

## **Hypothesis Testing: Errors**

- As stated earlier, Type I ($\alpha$) and Type II ($\beta$) errors are probabilities.
    - $\alpha = \text{P}[\text{reject } H_0 \text{ when } H_0 \text{ is true}]$
    - $\beta = \text{P}[\text{fail to reject } H_0 \text{ when } H_1 \text{ is true}]$
- We also call $\alpha$ the level of significance. 
- We should choose $\alpha$ based on the level of error we are willing to withstand in the experiment.
    - The $\alpha$ that is commonly used is $\alpha=0.05$.
    - Sometimes, smaller $\alpha$ is used. e.g., clinical trial $\to$  $\alpha=0.01$.
- For a fixed sample size ($n$), $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are inversely related.

## **Hypothesis Testing: Test Statistics**

- After stating our hypotheses, we will construct a test statistic. 
- The choice of test statistic depends on:
    1.  The hypotheses being tested.
    2. Assumptions made about the data.
- The value of the test statistic depends on the sample data. 
    -  If we were to draw a different sample, we would find a different value for the test statistic.
- We will use the test statistic on our way to drawing conclusions about the hypotheses.

## **Hypothesis Testing: *p*-Values**

::: {.callout-note}
## *p*-value 
The probability of observing what we've observed or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
:::

- After constructing test statistics, we will find the corresponding *p*-value.
- Finding a *p*-value depends on the distribution being used. 
- We will compare the *p*-value to $\alpha$ in order to draw conclusions.
    - Reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha$.

## **Hypothesis Testing: Conclusions and Interpretations**

- Once we've found the *p*-value, we can draw a conclusion. 
    - If $p < \alpha$, we **reject** $H_0$.
        -  There is sufficient evidence to suggest that $H_1$ is true.
    - If $p \ge \alpha$, we **fail to reject** $H_0$.
        - There is <u>not</u> sufficient evidence to suggest that $H_1$ is true.
- Take aways:
    - <u>**We never "accept" the null.**</u>
    - We <u>*always*</u> interpret in terms of $H_1$.
    
## **Two-Sample *t*-Test**

::: {.callout-note}
## Hypothesis Test for Two Independent Means
Hypotheses

- $H_0:$ $\mu_1-\mu_2 = \mu_0$ $|$ $H_0:$ $\mu_1-\mu_2 \le \mu_0$ | $H_0:$ $\mu_1-\mu_2 \ge \mu_0$
- $H_1:$ $\mu_1-\mu_2 \ne \mu_0$ | $H_0:$ $\mu_1 - \mu_2 > \mu_0$ | $H_1:$ $\mu_1 - \mu_2 < \mu_0$ 

Test Statistic
$$
t_0 = \frac{(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2)-\mu_0}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n}+\frac{s_2^2}{n}}}
$$

*p*-Value

- $p = 2 P[t \ge |t_0|]$ | $p = P[t \ge |t_0|]$ | $p = P[t \le |t_0|]$

Rejection Region

- Reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha$.

Conclusion/Interpretation

- [Reject or fail to reject] $H_0$.

- There [is or is not] sufficient evidence to suggest [alternative hypothesis in words].

:::

## **Two-Sample *t*-Test**

- R syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false
t.test(continuous_variable ~ grouping_variable,
       data = dataset_name,
       mu = hypothesized_difference,
       alternative = alternative)
```

- Important!!
    - We are estimating $\mu_1 - \mu_2$, but R is going to subtract in alphabetical or numeric order of the grouping variable.
        - e.g., if we have "Male" and "Female", it will estimate $\mu_{\text{Female}} - \mu_{\text{Male}}$.
        - e.g., if we have "110" and "5", it will estimate $\mu_{5} - \mu_{110}$.
        - In the case of two-tailed tets, this does not matter... but beware when doing a one-tailed test!

## **Two-Sample *t*-Test: Example**

- Consider the penguin data. Is there a significant difference in weight (*body_mass_g*) between male and female penguins? Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level.

- Remember the `R` syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false
t.test(continuous_variable ~ grouping_variable,
       data = dataset_name,
       mu = hypothesized_difference,
       alternative = alternative)
```

- What is the continuous variable?

- What is the grouping variable?

- What is the dataset name?

- What is the hypothesized difference?

- What is the alternative?

## **Two-Sample *t*-Test: Example**

- Consider the penguin data. Is there a significant difference in weight (*body_mass_g*) between male and female penguins? Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level.

- Remember the `R` syntax:

```{r}
t.test(body_mass_g ~ sex,
       data = penguins,
       mu = 0,
       alternative = "two")
```

- Is this a significant difference?

## **Two-Sample *t*-Test: Example**

**Hypotheses**

- $H_0:$ $\mu_1-\mu_2 = 0$
- $H_1:$ $\mu_1-\mu_2 \ne 0$ 

**Test Statistic and *p*-Value**

- $t_0 = -8.55$
- $p < 0.001$

**Rejection Region**

- Reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha$; $\alpha=0.05$.

**Conclusion/Interpretation**

- Reject $H_0$.

- There is sufficient evidence to suggest that male and female penguins have different weights.
    

## **Hypothesis Testing: Practical vs. Statistical Significance**

- Hypothesis testing depends on sample size.
- As the sample size increases, our *p*-values decrease necessarily. 
- As *p*-values decrease, we are more likely to reject the null hypothesis.
- We must ask ourselves if the value we are testing against makes practical sense.

    - A new weight loss medication where the average amount of weight lost was 15 lb over 6 months.

    - A new teaching method that raised final exam scores by 15 points.
