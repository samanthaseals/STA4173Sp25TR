## **Introduction**

-   In this lecture, we will review estimation
    -   Continuous variables
        -   Mean
        -   Median
        -   Percentiles / quartiles
        -   Variance and standard deviation
        -   Interquartile range
    -   Categorical variables
        -   Count
        -   Percentage
- We will also discuss exploring data graphically

## **R: Introduction**

-   In this course, we will review formulas, but we will use R for computational purposes
    -   Remember to refer to the lecture notes for specific code needed
    -   Code is also available on this course's GitHub repository
    
- You can install R and RStudio if you wish; both are free. 
    - We have access to the [Posit Workbench](https://rstudio.hmcse.uwf.edu/) ("the server") through HMCSE.

- I know that this is probably the first time you are seeing R (or any sort of programming).
    - That is why we have "R lab" time built in to our course. 
    - Remember that I am not looking for perfection, but instead for competency. 
    
## **Today's Data: Palmer Penguins**

- Today we will be demonstrating the basics using the [Palmer Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) dataset, available through R.

```{r}
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
penguins
```
    
## **Types of Variables**

::: {.callout-note}
## Continuous Variables
A continuous variable is a variable that can has an infinite set of possible values.
:::

- Between any two possible values, there are an infinite number of possible values.

- These typically arise from measurement. (Height, weight, etc.)

::: {.callout-note}
## Discrete Variables
A discrete variable is a variable that can only take on a finite set of possible values.
:::

- The possible values can usually be listed.

- These typically arise from categorizing (work vs. home) or counting.

## **Types of Variables**

```{r}
#| echo: false
penguins
```

## **Types of Continuous Variables**

::: {.callout-note}
## Ratio Variables
A ratio variable is a variable that has a meaningful zero point, allowing comparisons of magnitude.
:::

- True zero point indicates the absence of the quantity being measured.

- All arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are meaningful.

::: {.callout-note}
## Interval Variables
An interval variable has an arbitrary zero point and differences between values are meaningful.
:::

- The zero point does not indicate a true absence.

- A 1 unit difference always represents the same amount.

## **Types of Discrete Variables**

::: {.callout-note}
## Ordinal Variables
An ordinal variable has a meaningful order of responses; the exact differences between responses are not necessarily equal.
:::

- We understand which value is "greater" or "less," but not by how much.

- Arithmetic is not meaningful.

::: {.callout-note}
## Nominal Variables
A nominal variable has is no intrinsic order among the categories.
:::

- Categories are used merely as labels or names.

- No arithmetic or ordering operations are meaningful.

## **Measures of Centrality: Mean**

::: {.callout-note}
## Sample Mean
The sample mean provides a single number that can represent a "typical" or central value in your data.

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}
$$
:::

-   R syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false
dataset_name %>% summarize(mean(variable_name, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## **Measures of Centrality: Mean**

- Let's find the average weight (*body_mass_g*) of the penguins.

```{r}
penguins %>% summarize(mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- Let's find the average flipper length (*flipper_length_mm*) of the penguins.

```{r}
penguins %>% summarize(mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## **Measures of Centrality: Median**

::: {.callout-note}
## Sample Median
The sample median is the midpoint of a distribution, the number such that half the observations are smaller and the other half are larger. 
    
- If $n$ is odd, the median is the single middle value.
- If $n$ is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.
:::

- R syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false
dataset_name %>% summarize(median(variable_name, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## **Measures of Centrality: Median**

- Let's find the median weight (*body_mass_g*) of the penguins.

```{r}
penguins %>% summarize(median(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- Let's find the median flipper length (*flipper_length_mm*) of the penguins.

```{r}
penguins %>% summarize(median(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## **Measures of Spread: Variance and Standard Deviation**

::: {.callout-note}
## Sample Variance
The sample variance measures how "widely spread" the data points are around the mean.

$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \frac{(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i)^2}{n}}{n-1}$$
:::

- When we have a mound-shaped and symmetric distribution, most  observations will fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.

- Variance results in units^2^, which typically does not make sense.

::: {.callout-note}
## Sample Standard Deviation
The sample standard deviation also measures how "widely spread" the data points are around the mean.

$$s = \sqrt{s^2}$$
:::

- Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, measuring spread in the *original units* of the data.

- R syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false
dataset_name %>% summarize(var(variable_name, na.rm = TRUE), 
                           sd(variable_name, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## **Measures of Spread: Variance and Standard Deviation**

- Let's find the variance and standard deviation of the weight (*body_mass_g*) of the penguins.

```{r}
penguins %>% summarize(var(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),
                       sd(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- Let's find the variance and standard deviation of the flipper length (*flipper_length_mm*) of the penguins.

```{r}
penguins %>% summarize(var(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
                       sd(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## **Measures of Spread: Interquartile Range**

::: {.callout-note}
## Sample Interquartile Range
The sample interquartile range measures the spread of the middle 50% of data.

$$\text{IQR} = P_{75}-P_{25}$$
:::

- R syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false
dataset_name %>% summarize(IQR(variable_name))
```

## **Measures of Spread: Interquartile Range**

- Let's find the IQR of the weight (*body_mass_g*) of the penguins.

```{r}
penguins %>% summarize(IQR(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- Let's find the IQR of the flipper length (*flipper_length_mm*) of the penguins.

```{r}
penguins %>% summarize(IQR(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## **Mean & Standard Deviation vs. Median & IQR**

- When should we use the mean vs. the median to describe the center of the distribution?
    - Mound-shaped and symmetric $\to$ $\bar{x}$ & $s$.
    - Not mound-shaped and symmetric $\to$ $M$ & $\text{IQR}$.

- ... How do we know the shape of the distribution?

- We will explore histograms.

## **Graphs: Histograms (`R` code)**

- We are using the `ggplot2` package for graphing.
    - It will always start with `ggplot()`.
    - We will then layer elements on top.

- R syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false
dataset_name %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=variable_name)) + 
  geom_histogram() 
```

## **Graphs: Histograms**

- Let's look at the histogram of penguin weight (*body_mass_g*):

<center>
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_histogram() 
```
</center>

## **Graphs: Histograms**

- Let's look at the histogram of penguin weight (*body_mass_g*):

<center>
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)",
       y = "Number of Penguins",
       title = "Penguin Weight Distribution") +
  theme_bw()
```
</center>
