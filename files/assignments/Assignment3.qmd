**A regional airline transfers passengers from small airports to a larger regional hub airport. The airline's data analyst was assigned to estimate the revenue (in thousands of dollars) generated by each of the 22 small airports based on two variables: the distance from each airport (in miles) to the hub and the population (in hundreds) of the cities in which each of the 22 airports is located. The data are given here: [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ZN0jMYdVsG2ucIJFSTquVRW916Jj-JmZIGQuqSQhy0/edit?usp=sharing).**

```{r}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS CHUNK
library(tidyverse)
library(gsheet)
airline_data <- gsheet2tbl('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ZN0jMYdVsG2ucIJFSTquVRW916Jj-JmZIGQuqSQhy0/edit?usp=sharing')

**1. Model the revenue as a function of distance and population. Remember to state the resulting model.**

```{r}

```

**2. Provide brief interpretations for the slopes in the model.**

- **2a: distance -**

- **2b: population -**

**3. Use the appropriate hypothesis test to determine if distance is a significant predictor of revenue. Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level. Remember to typeset your results.**

```{r}

```

**4. Use the appropriate hypothesis test to determine if population is a significant predictor of revenue. Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level. Remember to typeset your results.**

```{r}

```

**5. Use the appropriate hypothesis test to determine if this is a significant regression line. Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level.**

```{r}

```

**6. How well does the data fit the line? Find the adjusted $R^2$ value and comment on it.**

```{r}

```

**7. How many observations are considered outliers?**

```{r}

```

**8. Create a second dataset that contains observations that are *not* classified as outliers.**

```{r}
airline_no_outliers <- airline_data %>%
  filter(abs(rstandard(model_name))>2.5)
```

<!-- Yes there will be an error until you have created your model
     and updated "model_name" in the code above -->

**9. Using the second dataset, model the revenue as a function of distance and population. Remember to state the resulting model.**

```{r}

```

**10. Provide brief interpretations for the slopes in the model.**

- **10a: distance -**

- **10b: population -**

**11. How different are the interpretations from those in Q2?**



**12. Use the appropriate hypothesis test to determine if distance is a significant predictor of revenue. Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level. Remember to typeset your results.**

```{r}

```

**13. Use the appropriate hypothesis test to determine if population is a significant predictor of revenue. Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level. Remember to typeset your results.**

```{r}

```

**14. How different are the results for Q12 and Q13 as compared to the full dataset's analysis in Q3 and Q4?**



**15. Use the appropriate hypothesis test to determine if this is a significant regression line. Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level.**

```{r}

```

**16. How different are the results for Q15 as compared to the full dataset's analysis in Q5?**



**17. Check the model assumptions - is our model valid?**

```{r}

```

**18. Why do you think I chose this as your project? What are you taking away from the analyses you have done?**
